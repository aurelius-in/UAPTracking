## Radar Trajectory Data

There are various datasets of radar data available for research purposes that can be used for moving object trajectory analysis. These datasets include:

- **DARPA Moving Target Recognition (MSTAR) dataset:** This dataset contains SAR and ISAR data of moving vehicles, including ground vehicles, aircraft, and ships.
- **University of California, Irvine (UCI) Radar dataset:** This dataset contains radar data collected from a moving vehicle using a pulsed Doppler radar system.
- **Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) MSTAR dataset:** This dataset contains SAR data of various military targets, including tanks, trucks, and armored personnel carriers.
- **DARPA Video Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) dataset:** This dataset contains SAR data and videos of moving vehicles and aircraft.
- **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radar dataset:** This dataset contains weather radar data that can be used to track the movement of precipitation.

These datasets are suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models for moving object tracking, including YOLO v5 and Faster R-CNN architectures. Note that access to some of these datasets may require permission from the data owners or institutions.
